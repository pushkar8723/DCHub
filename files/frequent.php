<h2>2. Filelist and Search Related</h2>
<p>If you cannot open a person's filelist and a Red-Bar appears underneath the user OR the user is indicated with red color and a brick wall on your DC Software. This happens if your firewall is ON then the incoming connection is not accepted and the file list of some users might not open on your system.</p>
<p>Also if you search something and not a single result shows up OR you get error messages like "Minimum Search interval is X seconds".</p>
<p>To rectify this please follow the following Steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a Firewall Exception for your DC Software (For details contact an Admin)
	<ul> 
	    <li>Open start menu and type Firewall Exception in Search box.</li>
	    <li>Open the "Allow application through Firewall".</li>
	    <li>If your DC Software is already on the list, then No Problem.</li>
	    <li>Else click on Change Settings (Top Right) and then Allow Another (Bottom Right).</li>
	    <li>Select Your DC Software and click Ok.</li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the above does not work, follow these steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Goto settings -- Connection Settings</li>
            <li>If Let "DC determine the best settings" is selected, then deselect it. </li>
            <li>Select the direct connection option.</li>
            <li>Close settings and rejoin the Hub.</li>
            <li>If problem persisits ask the other user to do the same.</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>If none of the above work, then your Software is crappy and thus please install Apex DC and apply the above settings.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2>3. Slot Related</h2>
<p>If you are not getting downloads slots for a file and you ask for a slot from the user but you still do not get a slot.</p>
<p>Try the following steps:</p>
<ol><li>Make sure that you send the pm for slots on the same Hub as the one in which you are queued for slots.</li>
    <li>If the user you were downloading from goes offline, Right click on the Download and Search for Alternates.</li>
